**Heart Disease Prediction Analysis**

- This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset of patient health metrics. The key steps and techniques include:

- Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and standardized features for improved model performance.
- Outlier Removal: Identified and removed extreme values to enhance model robustness.
- Resampling Techniques: Balanced the dataset by resampling to address class imbalance and ensure fair model evaluation.
- Model Building
- Algorithms Used: Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models, including:
Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
Logistic Regression (LR)
Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)

- Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

- Demonstrated the impact of data preprocessing and resampling on predictive accuracy.
- Identified the most effective model for heart disease prediction.
- Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
